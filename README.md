# Social-Network-API-C.18

## Description

I created a social network API so I could use it with insomnia to be able to create, add and remove users and thoughts. I built this project so the website can have large data structures.


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](Use mongoose to sync to the MongoDB database)
- [Usage](Get API routes in insomnia)
- [License](MIT license)

## Installation

In insomia test the API for POST PUT and DELETE requests.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits
